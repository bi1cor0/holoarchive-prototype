 ### Tools Used to Build
 - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Flexbox

## Overview
<p>I am a big fan of Hololive Productions ever since the middle of the Pandemic. The talents and streamers have not only given me great enjoyment and happiness over the years, but also a sense of community and inspiration in a turbulent time. In shourt, I've spent a lot of time engrossed in this very happy sect of the internet. And as such, I wanted to create a sort of an online diving board into the Hololive talents, and in turn the community itself. While other, more comprehensive and professional sites do exist: <br>

[Official Hololive Productions Website](https://hololivepro.com/en/)<br>
I mainly created my own website as a small project into web development. But also, I wanted to create a site that would mainly showcase and archive the in-jokes, special memorable moments, and memes the talents produce. Discovering these moments are what got me into the Hololive fandom in the first place. As the personality of the talents shown through during these moments, they made me smile. And that is how I got dragged into this deep rabbit-hole in the first place. </p>

## Features
<p>I'm not starting off with the entirety of Hololive right now. But only with Hololive's 4th generation of talent. Or, in other words, Hololive's fourth 5 member group of vtuber streamers. The reason why I chose the 4th Gen is because of the one that dragged me into the rabbit-hole in the first place: Hololive's very own dragon vtuber, Kiryu Coco. I first wanted to create a page that showcased Coco's best moments and jokes, in honor of her graduation from the company. And in doing so, I decided to go forward with her 4 other genmates as well, as they are all very close to one another. And are also very interesting themselves. <br>
The basic layout for each of the talent's pages are as follows: <br>
1. The streamer's name, short bio, and links to their social media. <br>
2. A list of the top 4 clips that showcase their most famous and talked about moments that essentially make them stand out. <br>
3. A fan submitted survey that has fans vote on what are the best memes or moments the talent has made.<br>
So far, the fan survey doesn't submit to anything. And I also included some fan art. As well as some screenshots of live concerts the talents have created. </p>

## Future Updates
<p> 1. To include an About page to discuss what this project is all about. Also, to give a beginner's introduction if necessary. But also maybe a suggestion box for further improvement. <br>
2. I would like to put a bootstrap carousel in each of the talent's pages in order to visually showcase the videos and memes so that each of the pages could be a bit mnore interactive. <br>
3. I hope to link to the talent's main YouTube channel whenver they go live on their platform. For example, if Kanata were to go live, the Holo Archive would recognize this, and her page will notify the user she is livestreaming. Similar to how YouTube shows a content creator is currently streaming by indicating on their profile pic. <br>
4. I would like to include the whole of Hololive as well. Not just the 4th Gen. <br>
5. I also would like this site, if it ever goes live, to keep updating I'm not sure how that would work, as in if I should allow fan input, or keep adding content to this site constantly. <br>
Side note: I'm not even sure if I should publish this on a live server or just keep working on it as practice for development. I'm still cooking on this project at the moment. 

## Challenging Parts
- 4/30/24: I had some flexbox issues when creating the landing page of the index. I wanted to sequence the grid a certain way, with the official Hololive logo in the middle for large screens. But when the screen/window would shrink or reduce, I wanted the logo to be the last one in sequence, with the talent's links to be the priority. I found out that initially, I had all divs within the parent flexbox div were the same ID. It was pointed out to me, that IDs should be different and unique. And once I changed it, the sequencing became easier to manipulate using CSS @media features.
